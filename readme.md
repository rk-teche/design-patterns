## Introduction

Design patterns and SOLID principles are essential concepts in software development that help in creating flexible, maintainable, and extensible code. This repository aims to provide clear and concise examples of different design patterns and SOLID principles to aid developers in understanding and implementing them effectively.

## Design Patterns

The repository covers a wide range of design patterns, including:

- Creational Patterns:
  - Factory Method
  - Abstract Factory
  - Singleton
  - Builder
  - Prototype

- Structural Patterns:
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy

- Behavioral Patterns:
  - Observer
  - Strategy
  - Command
  - Iterator
  - State
  - Template Method
  - Visitor
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Mediator
  - Interpreter
  - Memento

Each design pattern example is accompanied by detailed explanations, UML diagrams, and code implementations in various programming languages.

## SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines that assist in writing maintainable and flexible code. The repository covers the following SOLID principles:

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

For each SOLID principle, you will find a clear definition, examples, and code implementations in different programming languages.

## Examples

The repository provides practical examples that demonstrate how to apply design patterns and SOLID principles in real-world scenarios. Each example includes a detailed README file explaining the problem statement, the design pattern or SOLID principle used to solve it, and the corresponding code implementation. Examples are available in multiple programming languages to cater to different preferences.
